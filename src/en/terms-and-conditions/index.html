              14.4.3 Types of Orders

              </p><p class="txt tc-gray tw-400 mb-2">The Company shall provide the Client with an option to place, following order types:

              </p><p class="txt tc-gray tw-400 mb-2"><br>• A Market Order which is an order that the Company makes every effort to execute at the best available price. All orders are matched through the Company’s order book (Depth of Market), which is visible in the clients’ trading terminal before entering the market. The final price is based on the weighted average price through the layers depending on the size of the order. More information is provided in the Company’s website under the Trading section.
              <br>• A Limit Order which is an order to sell an instrument at no less than a specific price or buy an instrument at no more than a specific price. The Client may attach a stop loss and/or a take profit before the order is executed. Once the order is executed it automatically becomes a Market Order and the same conditions apply as Market Order.
              <br>• A Pending Order or an Entry Order which is an order to be executed at a later time and a price that the Client specifies. When the price reaches the price specified by the Client, then the order becomes a market order. Negative and positive slippage applies to pending orders. The Client has the option to place the following pending or entry orders:
              I. A Buy Limit Order, which is a pending or entry buy order placed below the current market price. If the market price drops to the level of the buy order that order is then triggered.
              II. A Buy Stop Order, which is a pending or entry buy order placed above the current market price. If the market price rises to the level of the buy order that order is then triggered.
              III. A Sell Limit Order, which is a pending or entry sell order placed above the current market price. If the market price rises to the level of the sell order that order is then triggered.
              IV. A Sell Stop Order, which is a pending or entry sell order placed below the current market price. If the market price drops to the level of the sell order that order is then triggered.
              V. A Buy Stop Limit order which is the combination of Buy Limit and Buy Stop orders, being a stop order to place a Buy Limit order. As soon as the future Ask price reaches the stop-level indicated in the order (the Price field), a Buy Limit order will be placed at the level, specified in Stop Limit price field. A stop level is set above the current Ask price, while Stop Limit price is set below the stop level.
              <br>• A Trailing Stop Order which is a stop loss order set in terms of points (pips) level below the market price – for a long position and above the market price – for a short position. The trailing stop price is adjusted as the price fluctuates.
              14.4.4 Such orders as Buy Limit, Buy Stop and Stop Loss/ Take Profit for opened short positions are executed as ASK price. Such orders as Sell Limit, Sell Stop and Stop Loss/Take Profit for opened long positions are executed at BID price. All orders once triggered are executed as Market Orders at the best available market price.
              14.5 Size of Order:

              </p><p class="txt tc-gray tw-400 mb-2"><br>• The size of an Order is expressed in lots. The minimum and the maximum order size may depend on the account type and/or asset class and/or particular instrument. The Company reserves the right to alter the minimum and/or maximum order size at any given time. A detailed information regarding available order sizes can be found on the Company’s Internet Website.
              14.6 Costs

              </p><p class="txt tc-gray tw-400 mb-2"><br>• The Client is charged a spread, financing/premium or commission, if applicable, in some Cryptocurrencies. Commissions and Financing are not incorporated into the Company’s quoted prices but charged separately. A detailed information regarding costs is provided in the Company’s website under the trading section.
              14.7 Upon closing a Transaction, and subject to any applicable adjustments for interest and dividends in accordance with this Agreement:

              </p><p class="txt tc-gray tw-400 mb-2"><br>• The Company will pay the Client the difference between the price in which the Transaction was opened and the price in which the Transaction was closed, multiplied by the number of units of the Underlying Instrument that comprise the Transaction if the Transaction is a buy Transaction and the Transaction’s closing price is higher than its opening price or a sell Transaction and the Transaction’s closing price is lower than its opening price
              <br>• The Client will pay the Company the difference between the price in which the Transaction was opened and the price in which the Transaction was closed, multiplied by the number of units of the Underlying Instrument that comprise the Transaction if the Transaction is a buy Transaction and the Transaction’s closing price is lower than its opening price or a sell Transaction and the Transaction’s closing price is higher than its opening price.
              14.8 Margin Call

              </p><p class="txt tc-gray tw-400 mb-2">A Margin Call occurs when the Account’s equity is about to drop below the margin requirement needed to maintain open Transaction(s). The Margin Call is set at the 150% equity-to-margin ratio. If the equity-to-margin ratio shall continue to drop, a Stop-out may occur.

              </p><p class="txt tc-gray tw-400 mb-2">14.9 Stop-out

              </p><p class="txt tc-gray tw-400 mb-2"><br>• A stop-out Occurs when the account’s equity drops below the margin requirement needed to maintain open Transaction(s). If the equity continues to drop, reaching 100% equity-to-margin ratio, Trading Platform will automatically start closing open positions (starting with those with the highest losses) to prevent zeroing out of the account. The Client should note that a Stop-out may occur even if the Account is fully hedged. When an account is fully hedged, the equity is affected by the floating PnL. If the spread widens, the floating PnL will increase. In this case, if floating PnL > equity, the account will get stopped out.
              <br>• When you open a position utilizing all of your funds it means that your margin level % will be near to 100%, which is the Stop out level % set by the Company. The Trading Platform cannot take under consideration the cost of spread before initiating the position, therefore, when the position is opened, and spread is taken into consideration your account margin level % may be equal or drop below 100% causing the stop out to trigger. You are solely responsible to ensure you have sufficient funds before entering into a position.
              14.10 It is the Company’s policy that the Client's Balance in the Account will never fall below zero. In the event that a Position is closed at such price causing the Equity to fall below zero, the Company shall waive its right to receive the balance from the Client (Negative Balance Protection).

              </p><p class="txt tc-gray tw-400 mb-2">14.11 Slippage

              </p><p class="txt tc-gray tw-400 mb-2">Due to fast moving markets, all type of Orders as disclosed in the General Trading Conditions section of the Agreement will be executed at prices worse or better due to Negative or Positive Slippage, although the Company will take all reasonable steps to provide Clients the best available price.It is important to note that Slippage does not affect the Negative Balance Protection and therefore the Client will never lose more than the amount invested (including any profit, if gained), even if a slippage occurs. In addition, transactions in some instruments which are not traded on a 24 hours basis, may experience a Market Gap on a daily basis and are therefore more susceptible to slippage.

              </p><p class="txt tc-gray tw-400 mb-2">14.12 Market Gap

              </p><p class="txt tc-gray tw-400 mb-2">The Client understands that a Market Gap may occur due to abnormal market conditions and/or as a result of the price difference between the closing and opening price. In case of a Market Gap, the Company shall execute all pending limit or stop orders at the first available market price for the corresponding position size.

              </p><p class="txt ts-20 tc-gray tw-500 mb-3 mt-4">15. ORDER ADJUSTMENTS

              </p><p class="txt tc-gray tw-400 mb-2">15.1.1 The Company reserves the right to suspend, close or unwind any Order/s which has resulted from any miss-configuration, technical error, bad pricing, and/or if the Company suspects any fraud, manipulation, arbitrage or other forms of deceitful or fraudulent activity in a Client’s account or multiple accounts with the Company or otherwise related or connected to any other Orders.

              </p><p class="txt tc-gray tw-400 mb-2">15.3 In the event of clause 15.1.2, the Client agrees that he/her can not claim any additional refund if the market order or market orders affected would have had a positive outcome if assumed open.

              </p><p class="txt tc-gray tw-400 mb-2"><br>• All order/s adjustments shall be performed with a balance correction equivalent to the amount resulted after the investigation was carried out and shall be reflected in the Client’s account Balance.
              <br>• In the case where a market order or multiple market orders executed at a bad price, the Company reserves the right to compensate the Client only with the price difference between the bad price and the actual market price at the moment of occurrence.

              <br>• The Client agrees that the Company will not at any case restore any closed orders as to comply with the laws and regulations of proper record keeping of Clients’ transaction history.
