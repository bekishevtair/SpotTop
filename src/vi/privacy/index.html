              1. INTRODUCTION
            </p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">1.1 In order to service our clients ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED we needs to collect personal data from our clients and/or potential clients, contact persons at suppliers and/or other business partners. The ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED also processes personal data about employees for the purpose of personnel administration. In light of the above, ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED wants to ensure a high level of data protection as privacy is a cornerstone in gaining and maintaining the trust of our clients and/or potential clients, contact persons at suppliers and/or other business partners and thus, ensuring ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED ’s future business. The same applies to the processing of personal data about the employees.</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">Protection of personal data requires among other things that appropriate technical and organisational measures are implemented to demonstrate a high level of data protection. the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED has adopted a number of internal and external data protection policies, which must be followed by employees of the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED.</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">Additionally, the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED will monitor, audit and document internal compliance with the data protection policies and applicable statutory data protection requirements, including the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”).</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">The ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED will also take the necessary steps in order to enhance data protection compliance within the organisation. These steps include the assignment of responsibilities, raising awareness and training within data protection of staff involved in processing operations. Please note that this data protection guideline will be reviewed from time to time to take into account any new obligations. Retention of personal data will be governed by our most recent retention policy.</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">This data protection guideline, along with guidelines for processing of personal data, constitute the overall framework for processing of personal data within the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">1.2 “Personal data” is any information which may be related to an identified or identifiable natural person (“data subject”). An identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, location data, phone number, age, gender, etc. Such personal data can for instance concern an employee, a job applicant, client/potential client, supplier and other business partners.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">1.3 Personal data can be categorized as ordinary non-sensitive personal data or special categories of personal data (sensitive personal data). Special categories of personal data are exhaustively outlined in the GDPR and include personal data revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, bio-metric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person's sex life or sexual orientation. Ordinary non-sensitive personal data include all information that is not categorized as special categories of personal data (sensitive personal data). Such information can be name, address, telephone number, employee id, information about education, etc. Certain ordinary non-sensitive personal data may be considered confidential. This may, for instance, include information on income and wealth, and information on internal family relationships/matters. Confidential, ordinary non-sensitive data are normally subject to further security measures.</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">The category of personal data will have an impact on which legal basis the processing of such personal data can be based on. Special rules apply to the processing of data about criminal offences and CPR-numbers. The various legal bases are described below in clause 2.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">1.4 Although information regarding companies/businesses is not as such personal data, please note that information relating to contact persons within such companies/businesses, e.g. name, title, work email, work phone number, etc. is considered personal data. However, personal data relating to a personally owned and run business are considered as personal data even if the personal data concern the business. Such personal data are considered as relating to an identified or identifiable natural person.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">1.5 ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED collects and uses personal data for a variety of legitimate business purposes, including establishment and management of customer and supplier relationships, completion of purchase agreements, recruitment and management of all aspects of terms and conditions of employment, communication, fulfillment of legal obligations or requirements, performance of contracts, providing services to clients, etc. When carrying out such processing activities, the first step is to ensure that the general principles relating to the processing of personal data are complied with.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">1.6 Pursuant to the general principles personal data shall always be:
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">Processed lawfully, fairly and in a transparent manner in relation to the data subject (principle of lawfulness, fairness and transparency);
              Collected for specified, explicit and legitimate purposes and not further processed in a manner that is incompatible with those purposes (principle of purpose limitation);
              adequate, relevant and limited to what is necessary in relation to the purposes for which they are processed (principle of data minimisation);
              accurate and, where necessary, kept up to date; every reasonable step must be taken to ensure that personal data that are inaccurate, having regard to the purposes for which they are processed, are erased or rectified without delay (principle of accuracy);
              kept in a form which permits identification of data subjects for no longer than is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data is processed (principle of storage limitation);
              processed in a manner that ensures appropriate security of the personal data, including protection against unauthorised or unlawful processing and against accidental loss, destruction or damage, using appropriate technical or organisational measures (principle of integrity and confidentiality).</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">1.7 The ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED shall be responsible for and be able to demonstrate compliance with the above (principle of accountability). This principle is one of the reasons that we have prepared this data protection guideline and why it is important that you read it thoroughly.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-20 tc-gray tw-500 mb-3 mt-4">2. LEGAL BASIS FOR THE PROCESSING OF PERSONAL DATA
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">2.1 Besides complying with the general principles relating to the processing of personal data, the processing of the personal data must also be based on a legal basis. The legal basis will depend on, which category of personal data is being processed.</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">The most predominant legal bases for processing ordinary non-sensitive personal data, such as, name, address, email, telephone number, credit card information, etc., within ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED are:
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">The performance of a contract to which the data subject is party;
              A legal obligation or requirement to which ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED is party; and
              Legitimate interests pursued by ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED or by a third party.</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">In certain cases, if none of the above legal bases can be applied, the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED will obtain the data subjects' consent to the processing.</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">The most predominant legal bases for processing special categories of personal data (if any) within the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED are:
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">Explicit consent from the data subject(s) for one or more specific purposes;
              To comply with obligations and exercising specific rights of the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED or the data subject in the field of employment and social security and social protection law; and
              If the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">Below, follows a more detailed description of the legal bases.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">2.2 Performance of a contract
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">2.2.1 It will be legitimate to collect and process personal data relevant to the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract. This applies to all contractual obligations and agreements signed with the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED, including the pre-contractual phase irrespective of the success of the contract negotiation.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">2.3 Compliance with a legal obligation
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">2.3.1 The ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED must comply with various legal obligations and requirements, which are based on Union or Member State law. Such legal obligations, to which the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED is subject, may be sufficient as a legitimate basis for the processing of personal data.
              2.3.2 Such legal obligations include obligations to collect, register and/or make available certain types of information relating to employees, clients, etc. Such legal requirements will then form the legal basis for us to process the personal data, however, it is important to note whether the provisions allowing or requiring the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED to process certain personal data also set out requirements in relation to storage, disclosure and deletion.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">2.4 Legitimate interests
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">2.4.1 Personal data will only be processed where it is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED , and these interests or fundamental rights are not overridden by the interests of the data subject. the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED will, when deciding to process personal data, ensure that the legitimate interests do not override the rights and freedoms of the individual and that the processing will not cause unwarranted harm. An example of a legitimate interest of the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED is to process personal data on potential clients in order to expand the business and develop new business relations. The data subject must be given information on the specific legitimate interests pursued by the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED if a processing is based on this legal basis, cf. clause 4.1 below.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">2.5 Consent

</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">2.5.2 A consent shall be freely given, specific, informed and unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes.</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">The data subject must actively consent to the processing of personal data by a statement or by a clear affirmative action.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">2.5.3 A request for consent shall be presented in a manner, which is clearly distinguishable from other matters, in an intelligible and easily accessible form, using clear and plain language.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">2.5.4 To process special categories of personal data (sensitive personal data) the consent shall also be explicit.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">2.5.5 The data subject is entitled to withdraw his/her consent at any time and upon such withdrawal, we will stop collecting and/or processing personal data about that person unless we are obligated or entitled to do so based on another legal basis.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">2.6 Obligations and exercising specific rights of the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED or the data subject
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">2.6.1 This legal basis will in most cases only be relevant if the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED processes health data about the employees to comply with the rules pursuant to employment law or collective agreements, e.g. reimbursement of sickness benefits, etc.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">2.7 Legal claims
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">2.7.1 This legal basis will be relevant if it is necessary for the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED to process personal data in order to establish, exercise or defend a legal claim towards a third party, for instance a client or an employee.
</p>

</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">3.1 The ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED as Data Controller
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">3.1.1 The ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED is in most cases processing personal data as a data controller, as the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data, e.g. when the processing relates to the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED's clients, other business partners and employees.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">3.2 Use of data processors
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">3.2.1 An external data processor is a company, which processes personal data on behalf of the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED and in accordance with the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED’s documented instructions, including for the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED's purposes and by means set-out by the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED, e.g. in relation to providers of HR systems, third party IT providers, etc. When the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED outsources the processing of personal data to data processors, the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED ensures that said company as a minimum implements the same degree of security measures for the protection of personal data protection as the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED. If this cannot be guaranteed, the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED will choose another data processor. The processing by a data processor is governed by a data processing agreement.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">3.3 Data processing agreements
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">3.3.1 Prior to transfer of personal data to the data processor, the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED shall assess whether the data processor provides sufficient guarantees to implement appropriate technical and organisational measures in such a manner that processing will meet the requirements of the GDPR and ensure the protection of the rights of the data subjects. After the assessment is carried out and it is determined that the data processor meets such requirements, the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED shall enter into a written data processing agreement with the data processor. The data processing agreement ensures that the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED controls the processing of personal data, which takes place outside the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED for which the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED is the data controller and thereby responsible.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">3.3.2 If the data processor/sub-data processor is located outside the EU/EEA, the conditions of clause 3.4.2 below will apply
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">3.4 Disclosure of personal data to other independent data controllers
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">3.4.1 Before disclosing personal data to others, i.e. other independent data controllers, it is the responsibility of the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED to ensure that the general principles relating to the processing of personal data are complied with. Further, it is the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED's responsibility to ensure that the disclosure of the personal data is based on a legal basis.
</p>

              <p class="txt ts-18 tc-gray tw-400 mb-1 mt-2">3.4.2 If the third-party recipient is located outside the EU/EEA in a third country that does not ensure an adequate level of personal data protection, the transfer can only be completed if the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED is providing appropriate safeguards. This will be done by entering into a transfer agreement between the ACE HOLDINGS LIMITED and the third party. The transfer agreement shall be based on the EU Standard Contractual Clauses.
</p>
